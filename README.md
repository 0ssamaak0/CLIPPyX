# Main Features
- ðŸŸ¡ **Search by Image Caption**: Search by any text or phrase that matches the image description.

- ðŸ”µ **Search by Textual Content in Images**: Search by the semantic meaning of the text in your images.

- ðŸŸ¡ **Search by Image Similarity**: Provide an existing image as a reference as a path or a URL, CLIPPyX will find visually similar images using CLIP.

# Tool Overview

![CLIPPyX Overview](assets/CLIPPyX_diag.png)

- **CLIP**:
[OpenAI's CLIP](https://openai.com/index/clip/) is the main component of CLIPPyX. It's to store all image embeddings in a vector database to query later.

- **OCR & Text Embedding**:
OCR is applied to all images to extract text from them, then these texts are embedded using a text embedding model and stored in a vector database to perform text-based search.

- **CLIPPyX Server**:
CLIPPyX server receives the search query from the [UI](#User-Interface), and then it queries the collections of image embeddings and text embeddings to return the relevant images.

# Getting Started
## Installation
- Install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- Clone the repository
- in the root directory, run the command

```
pip install -e .
```
## Settings
- CLIPPyX provides a UI to select the settings (can be configured from `config.yaml` too) to access the settings UI run:
```
CLIPPyX --settings
```
The settings you can set are:
- Deep Scan: Deepscan ensures if a file content has changed but the file name is the same, it will still be reindexed (It may affect performance for large directories)
- Batch Size: 
- Scan Method:
    - Default: You manually select paths to include/exclude in your search
    - Voidtools Everything (Windows Only): If you have [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com) installed, you can use its index
- CLIP Provider: 
    - Apple's [MobileClip](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/mobileclip) 
    - any CLIP model from Huggingface ðŸ¤— Transformers
- Text Embedding Provider: 
    - Any text embedding model from Huggingface ðŸ¤— Transformers
    - Ollama
    - llama.cpp
    - Any OpenAI Compatible API (e.g., Fireworks.ai)

## Running CLIPPyX
- To start CLIPPyX server, run 
```
CLIPPyX
```

Some models may download automatically the first time you run CLIPPyX, then you should see the indexing process starting. When the indexing process you can search through any UI

```
 * Serving Flask app 'server'
 * Debug mode: off
INFO:werkzeug:WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:23107
 * Running on http://172.25.97.13:23107
 ```

You can check the server is running by sending a simple request to the server using CURL or Postman.

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"text\": \"Enter your query here\"}" http://localhost:23107/clip_text
```
